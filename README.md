Library Management System (Python)
A simple library management system for a librarian. 
The librarian is able to check available books out and return any books they currently have. 
Details of all books in the library in an SQLite database. 
For each book the title, author, genre, current loan status (is it available, and if not, who has it?), purchase date, unique ID number (which can be used to identify different copies of the same book), and loan period (which could be 7 days or 28 days) is stored.
Aplication runs from menu.py
